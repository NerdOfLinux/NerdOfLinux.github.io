    <p> Welcome to my first ever tutorial written on this site!!!! I will do my best to teach you the basics of HTML so you can start making basic-looking websites. Most websites have more than just HTML, but we'll talk about that in another lesson.
    <h2> What you'll need </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> A web browser </li>
      <li> A basic text editor(not Word, but something like notepad) </li>
      <li> You could also use something like the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic" target="_blank"> Tryit Editor </a> from w3schools(I use it a lot)</li>
      <li> Time and patience </li>
    </ul>
  <h2> Let's start! </h2>
    <p> The nice thing about starting with just HTML is that it's 100% client side, meaning you won't need a server to host it. Simply make a .html file, and open it your browser! Be sure to use a simple text editor that won't format your text, or else you might have some problems.
    <p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it is the language that the internet is written in. Sure, CSS, javascript, and a ton of other languages are also important, but HTML is still the core. The most important thing in HTML is tags, they look something like:
  <!--- Thank you, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2820453/display-html-code-in-html -->
  <pre> &lttag&gt content &lt/tag&gt </pre>
    <p> Tags basically tell the browser when something starts and when something ends. The tag you'll use most is probably the &ltp&gt tag, which is used to define a paragraph. 
    <p> Now, onto the creating the site part! First, open your text editor, and copy and paste the following: 
    <pre>
    &lthtml&gt
      &lthead&gt
        &lttitle&gt This is the title &lt/title&gt
      	&lth1&gt This is the header &lt/h1&gt
      &lt/head&gt
      &ltbody&gt
        This is the body of your site.
      &lt/body&gt
    &lt/html&gt
    </pre>
  and open it in a file.
  <p> The &lthtml&gt tag is at the top of more or less any website you go to, and is there so the browser knows that the HTML is starting. The &lthead&gt tag is short for header, and this is where I like to put the &lttitle&gt tag, which sets the tab title, and the &lth1&gt tag, which is the biggest heading text tag. All tags close with &lt/tag&gt(replace tag with the actual tag name). The &ltbody&gt tag is where the main content usually lives. 
  <p> Past the above HTML code in a file called index.html, and open it in your browser. Then, replace the text in between the tags to whatever you want.
