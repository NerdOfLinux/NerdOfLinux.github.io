    <p> Welcome to my first ever tutorial written on this site!!!! I will do my best to teach you the basics of HTML so you can start making basic-looking websites. Most websites have more than just HTML, but we'll talk about that in another lesson.
    <h2> What you'll need </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> A web browser </li>
      <li> A basic text editor(not Word, but something like notepad) </li>
      <li> Time and patience </li>
    </ul>
  <h2> Let's start! </h2>
    <p> The nice thing about starting with just HTML is that it's 100% client side, meaning you won't need a server to host it. Simply make a .html file, and open it your browser! Be sure to use a simple text editor that won't format your text, or else you might have some problems.
    <p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it is the language that the internet is written in. Sure, CSS, javascript, and a ton of other languages are also important, but HTML is still the core. The most important thing in HTML is tags, they look something like:
  <pre> <tag> content </tag> </pre>
    <p> 
 </body>
  </div>
</html>
