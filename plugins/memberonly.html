  <p> I wanted to create member only content that did not show a description on posts pages, so I finally decided to create a plugin. </p>
  <p> All you need to do is install it, and then you can customize the message, sign in link, and whether or not to redirect the user to the post after loggin in. It works by checking if a post is in a category, and if it is, it displays the login message. It doesn't matter if a post is in multiple categories, if one is assigned as member only, it will be blocked to not signed in users.
  <p> The first thing I do before installing a plugin is checking when it was last updated, and if you're one of those people, read this carefully: <strong> I don't have a lot of free time, but I use the plugin on my site, and it is compatible with the latest version of WordPress even if it wasn't updated that recently. </strong>

      Just upload it as a WordPress plugin and configure it. </p>

    <p>To make your own plugin, I suggest these guides(the ones I think I used):

   <p> Like all other WordPress plugins, I decided to publish it under the GPL license, and you can view its source code <a href="https://github.com/NerdOfLinux/MemberOnly" target="_blank"> on its GitHub page </a>.</p>
