  <p> I wanted to create member only content that did not show a description on posts pages, so I finally decided to create a plugin. </p>
  <p> Like all other WordPress plugins, I decided to publish it under the GPL license, and you can view its source code <a href="https://github.com/NerdOfLinux/MemberOnly" target="_blank"> on its GitHub page </a>.</p>
