  <p> Hello and welcome to my site. Unlike my blog, <a href="https://gateblogs.com" target="_blank"> Gate Blogs </a>, this website is hand coded. You can view all its source code on my GitHub page. Speaking of GitHub, this site is actually hosted on GitHub pages, a free way to get your site online. I set mine up to use a custom  subdomain, but that is optional, and GitHub gives you a free one if you want.
  <p> This site uses absolutely no server side languages, and is 100% client side, including the forms. This started off as a site for just my WordPress plugin, but I decided to make it useful, so I created the tools page. I hope you find this site and all of its tools useful!
